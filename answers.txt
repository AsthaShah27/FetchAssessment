1.) What questions do you have about the data?
- Are there any specific data points or metrics that are currently missing but would be valuable for our analysis?
- How frequently is the data updated, and what processes are in place to ensure its accuracy?

2.) How did you discover the data quality issues?
- Data quality issues were discovered through comprehensive data validation checks during the transformation process. We used Pandas to identify missing, inconsistent, and duplicate data.

3.) What do you need to know to resolve the data quality issues?
- Information on current data entry processes and validation rules.
- Access to raw data sources to cross-verify and correct discrepancies.

4.) What other information would you need to help you optimize the data assets you're trying to create?
- Detailed user behavior data and feedback.
- Market and competitor data for contextual benchmarking.

5.) What performance and scaling concerns do you anticipate in production and how do you plan to address them?
- Data Volume Growth: Plan to use indexing and partitioning strategies.
- Real-Time Processing: Considering scalable database solutions like PostgreSQL or NoSQL databases.
- Scalability: Implementing cloud-based solutions for scalable storage and compute power.
